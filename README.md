Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe Xlinked genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 3,500 male births. Characterized by progressive muscle weakening and reduced life expectancy, DMD presents a significant challenge in identifying reliable genetic expression biomarkers due to its wide phenotypic variability. The potential roles of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) as disease markers have been debated for over two decades. This study employs a novel single-nucleus RNA (snRNA) transcriptomic analysis to evaluate the expression of AQP1 and AQP4 in DMD muscle tissue. The results demonstrate a significant upregulation of AQP1 in DMD samples compared to controls, while AQP4 expression was elevated but did not reach statistical significance. These findings contribute to the understanding of aquaporin involvement in DMD pathophysiology and highlight the potential of AQP1 as a biomarker for the disease. Furthermore, this research addresses a critical gap in knowledge regarding the role of aquaporins in DMD and opens new avenues for future investigations into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.
